# Project: seattle AirBNB open Data

# Install

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
lightgbm
keras
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

I recommend you install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project

# Motivation for the project
This is one of 2nd term projects of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity. The goal of the project is to write a blog post to share the result of the analysis of [Seattle AirBNB Data] (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) using CRISP-DM process(Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) to answer the three questions

What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Seattle?


What kinds of Airbnb homes are popular?


What are the most of features or the most components in the data? 

To answer the questions, Seattle Airbnb dataset was cleaned by dropping irrelevant features, imputing Nan data, changing from categorical values to numerical values to be ready to be fed in a model be transformed by PCA(Principal component analysis).

# File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions


data.zip which contains 3 files csv contains observations about seattle AirBNB open Data
